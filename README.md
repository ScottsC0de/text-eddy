## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
This project was created to demonstrate the installation and application of *Webpack plug-ins* to create a *Progressive Web Application* in the form of a Text Editor. WebPack plug-ins are npms that allow us to build modern applications using JavaScript objects installed here: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/. They are then linked to our projects by running the proper commands (see [Installation](#installation-id) steps). You can save your data for future use using *IndexDB*. IndexDB stores client side storage and Binary Large Objects. BLOB is a generic term used to describe the handling and storage of long strings of data by database management systems. One of these webpack plug-ins include *Manifest*, which manages the bundling of our code and creates a connection between webpack and our code. Manifest plug-in handles the downloading of modules in our browser. This application also uses *Service Workers*, which work in between the browser, our web app, and the network. Service workers allow us to use applications offline.

Set up in a webpack.config.js file, we have imported the webpack plugin Manifest so that we can download the proper bundles necessary for setting up our application. Service workers are imported in src-sw.js files

```js
Command line steps for initial build

- npm run start:dev
- concurrently \"cd client && npm run build\" \"cd server && npm run server\"
- npm run build && cd server && node server.js
- cd server node server.js --ignore client
- cd client && npm run build
- cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i
- cd client && npm start
```

<br>

```js
package.json "scripts" object

"scripts": {
        "start:dev": "concurrently \"cd client && npm run build\" \"cd server && npm run server\" ",
        "start": "npm run build && cd server && node server.js",
        "server": "cd server node server.js --ignore client",
        "build": "cd client && npm run build",
        "install": "cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i",
        "client": "cd client && npm start"
    }

Importing Webpack & Manifest in JavaScript

const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const WebpackPwaManifest = require('webpack-pwa-manifest');
const path = require('path');
const { InjectManifest } = require('workbox-webpack-plugin');
```

<br>

```js
Importing Service Worker in JavaScript

const { offlineFallback, warmStrategyCache } = require('workbox-recipes');
const { CacheFirst } = require('workbox-strategies');
const { registerRoute } = require('workbox-routing');
const { CacheableResponsePlugin } = require('workbox-cacheable-response');
const { ExpirationPlugin } = require('workbox-expiration');
const { precacheAndRoute } = require('workbox-precaching/precacheAndRoute');
```

## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage
Upon arriving to the site (heroku link), you will see a basic text editor with name 'Jate' written in capital letters. Click anywhere in the text editor to begin typing, using all basic keyboard commands for input (<kbd>Enter</kbd> for new line, <kbd>Space</kbd> between letters, <kbd>Shift</kbd> for capital letters, etc). You may install onto your local machine by clicking the <button> Install </button> at the top left corner of the page. This will allow you to use the app offline. Your changes are also automatically saved with IndexDB. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" target="_blank">Learn More</a>)

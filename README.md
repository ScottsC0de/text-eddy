## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
This project was created to demonstrate the installation and application of *Webpack plug-ins* to create a *Progressive Web Application* in the form of a Text Editor. WebPack plug-ins allow us to build modern applications using JavaScript objects installed here: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/. They are then linked to our projects by running the proper commands (see [Installation](#installation-id) steps). You can save your data for future use using *IndexDB*. IndexDB stores client side storage and Binary Large Objects. BLOB is a generic term used to describe the handling and storage of long strings of data by database management systems.

 & install the app to your local machine so it can be used offline. 
*Service Workers*
*Manifest*

## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage
Upon arriving to the site (heroku link), you will see a basic text editor with name 'Jate' written in capital letters. Click anywhere in the text editor to begin typing, using all basic keyboard commands for input (<kbd>Enter</kbd> for new line, <kbd>Space</kbd> between letters, <kbd>Shift</kbd> for capital letters, etc). You may install onto your local machine by clicking the <button> Install </button> at the top left corner of the page. This will allow you to use the app offline. Your changes are also automatically saved with IndexDB. (<a href="">learn more</a>)
